Project Overview
This project implements a Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) system using the Aleo SDK to verify vaccination records. The primary goal is to allow users to prove their vaccination status without revealing sensitive personal information, enhancing privacy and security in health data sharing.

Use Case
Scenario
In today’s world, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic, the need for secure and private verification of vaccination statuses has become increasingly important. Organizations, such as employers, schools, and healthcare providers, often require proof of vaccination before granting access to services or events. However, sharing sensitive health information raises concerns regarding privacy and data security.

Objectives
Privacy Preservation: Allow users to verify their vaccination status without disclosing any personal information (e.g., name, date of birth).
User Control: Empower users to have control over their data and share only what is necessary.
Secure Verification: Utilize Zero-Knowledge Proofs to ensure that the verification process is secure and tamper-proof.
Target Audience
Individuals: Users who wish to prove their vaccination status without sharing sensitive data.
Organizations: Employers, educational institutions, and event organizers who need a secure way to verify vaccination statuses.
Technologies Used
Aleo SDK: A software development kit that allows for the creation of privacy-preserving applications using Zero-Knowledge Proofs.
Node.js: A JavaScript runtime used for building the backend of the application.
JavaScript: The programming language used for developing the logic of the verification process.
Installation
To set up this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aleo-vaccination-verification.git
cd aleo-vaccination-verification
Install Dependencies: Make sure you have Node.js installed. Then, install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
npm install aleo-sdk
Set Up Environment: Ensure that any necessary environment variables are set up if required (e.g., for local development).

Usage
To run the verification process, use the following steps:

Open Terminal: Navigate to the project directory where the index.js file is located.

Run the Script:

bash
Copy code
node index.js
Output: The console will display the verification process, confirming whether the vaccination record has been verified successfully without disclosing personal details.

Example Health Record
You can modify the userHealthRecord object in the index.js file to test different vaccination statuses:

javascript
Copy code
const userHealthRecord = {
    vaccination: "DiseaseX",
    date: "2023-01-15",
};
Code Structure
Here’s an overview of the key files and their purposes:

index.js: The main entry point of the application where the vaccination verification logic is implemented.
README.md: This documentation file providing detailed information about the project.
Key Functions
verifyVaccinationStatus(healthRecord): This function implements the logic to generate and verify the Zero-Knowledge Proof for the given health record.

 Use Case: Private Health Verification for Women’s Health
Scenario:
Imagine a system that allows women to prove their health status without disclosing personal details. For example, verifying a vaccination record (e.g., for a vaccine against a specific illness) in a workplace or public space without revealing other sensitive health information.

Example Use Case:

Verification of Vaccination: Women can verify they have been vaccinated for a specific disease without revealing additional medical history or personal information.
Privacy: This system leverages Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) to confirm status without sharing any specifics about dates, providers, or personal details.
Implementation Goal:
We will create a minimal ZKP-based Node.js app to verify a user’s vaccination status privately. Using the Aleo SDK, we'll simulate a ZKP to prove that a person has a specific health record (e.g., a vaccination) without exposing underlying details.
